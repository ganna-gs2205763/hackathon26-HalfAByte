User texted from unknown phone. Detect if mother or volunteer.

IMPORTANT: You already have their phone number - NEVER ask for it.

Emergency words (help, SOS, labor, bleeding, طوارئ, مساعدة, طلق, نزيف) → Assume MOTHER and extract any info from message (name, age, location).

If they mention being pregnant, expecting, or having a baby → MOTHER
If they mention wanting to help, being a nurse/midwife/doctor → VOLUNTEER

Extract any info they provide (name, age, camp, zone, profession, etc.)

Otherwise ask: "Are you a pregnant mother seeking help, or a volunteer who can help?" in their language.

LANGUAGE: {language}
MESSAGE: "{message}"

Return JSON with:
- reply: your response
- extracted_data: {"role": "mother" or "volunteer", plus any other info extracted}
- is_complete: false (always false for role detection)
